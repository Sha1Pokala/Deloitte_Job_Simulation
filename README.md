📂 Project Breakdown

📌 Task 1: Telemetry Data Analysis (Tableau)
Objective: Identify the factory with the most machine failures and determine which machines broke down most often.

Steps:
1️⃣ Import Daikibo telemetry data into Tableau
2️⃣ Create a calculated measure (Unhealthy = 10 mins of downtime per failure)
3️⃣ Build two bar charts:

📊 "Down Time per Factory"
📊 "Down Time per Device Type"
4️⃣ Create a dashboard with interactivity
5️⃣ Capture screenshot of the worst-performing factory
📌 Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Analysis (Excel)
Objective: Categorize Equality Scores into Fair, Unfair, or Highly Discriminative classes.

Steps:
1️⃣ Open Equality Table.xlsx in Excel
2️⃣ Add a new column: "Equality Class"
3️⃣ Apply classification rules:

Fair (-10 ≤ score ≤ 10)
Unfair (score < -10 or score > 10)
Highly Discriminative (score < -20 or score > 20)
4️⃣ Save & upload the edited file
